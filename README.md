# Forge

Forge is a GNOME Shell extension that provides tiling/window management.

## Extensions
You can install from: https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4481/forge/ or download the source and `make install`, restart gnome-shell after or `make dev`.

## Features
- Tree-based tiling with vertical and horizontal split containers similar to i3-wm.
- Vim-like keybindings for navigation/swapping windows/moving windows in the containers.
- Support for floating windows, smart gaps and focus hint.
- Customizable shortcuts in extension preferences.
- Some support for multi-display.
- Works on GNOME 3.36+ and 40. X11 and Wayland.

## GNOME Defaults

GNOME Shell has built in support for workspace management and seems to work well - so Forge will not touch those.

User is encouraged to bind the following:
- Switching/moving windows to different workspaces
- Switching to numbered, previous or next workspace
